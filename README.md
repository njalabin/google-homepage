// Write a brief introduction for what the current project is and what skills you have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project which is a good way to review what you have learned.)



Mini-project to deconstruct and rebuild the Google web page.

Used mainly flexbox to style the page.

Followed a tutorial in youtube for guidance in using flexbox to position elements especially the header nav bar and footer. 

Utilised chrome developer tool to inspect and get data on certain css styles.
